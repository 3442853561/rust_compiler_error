Types in type definitions have lifetimes associated with them that represent how long the data stored within them is guaranteed to be live. This lifetime must be as long as the data needs to be alive, and missing the constraint that denotes this will cause this error.

```rust
// This won't compile because T is not constrained, meaning the data
// stored in it is not guaranteed to last as long as the reference
struct Foo<'a, T> {
    foo: &'a T
}
```

This will compile, because it has the constraint on the type parameter:

```rust
struct Foo<'a, T: 'a> {
    foo: &'a T
}
```

To see why this is important, consider the case where T is itself a reference (e.g., T = &str). If we don't include the restriction that T: 'a, the following code would be perfectly legal:

```rust
struct Foo<'a, T> {
    foo: &'a T
}

fn main() {
    let v = "42".to_string();
    let f = Foo{foo: &v};
    drop(v);
    println!("{}", f.foo); // but we've already dropped v!
}
```
