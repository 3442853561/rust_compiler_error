# E0007

---

This error indicates that the bindings in a match arm would require a value to be moved into more than one location, thus violating unique ownership. Code like the following is invalid as it requires the entire Option<String> to be moved into a variable called op_string while simultaneously requiring the inner String to be moved into a variable called s.


```rust
let x = Some("s".to_string());

match x {
    op_string @ Some(s) => {}, // error: cannot bind by-move with sub-bindings
    None => {},
}
```

此错误表示匹配中的绑定将需要将值move到多个位置，从而违反唯一所有权。 像下面这样的代码是无效的，因为它需要将整个Option <String> move到一个名为op_string的变量中，同时要求将内部String移动到变量s中。


```rust
let x = Some("s".to_string());

match x {
    op_string @ Some(s) => {}, // error: cannot bind by-move with sub-bindings
    None => {},
}
```
