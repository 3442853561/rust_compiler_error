You tried to give a lifetime parameter to a type which doesn't need it. Erroneous code example:

```rust

type X = u32<'static>; // error: lifetime parameters are not allowed on
                       //        this type
```

Please check that the correct type was used and recheck its definition; perhaps it doesn't need the lifetime parameter. Example:

```rust
type X = u32; // ok!
```

你试图给一个不需要生命周期参数的类型赋予一个生命周期参数，错误代码如下：

```rust

type X = u32<'static>; // error: 该类型不允许添加生命周期参数
```

请检查是否使用正确的类型并重新检查其定义，也许它不需要生命周期参数。比如：

```rust
type X = u32; // ok!
```
