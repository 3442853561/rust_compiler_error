Types in type definitions have lifetimes associated with them that represent how long the data stored within them is guaranteed to be live. This lifetime must be as long as the data needs to be alive, and missing the constraint that denotes this will cause this error.

```
// This won't compile because T is not constrained to the static lifetime
// the reference needs
struct Foo<T> {
    foo: &'static T
}
```

This will compile, because it has the constraint on the type parameter:

```rust
struct Foo<T: 'static> {
    foo: &'static T
}
```

类型定义中的类型包含与其关联的生命周期，表示存储于其中的数据的生命周期。这个生命周期必须要和数据一样长，如果缺少这份约束将导致错误。


```
// 下面代码将不会编译，因为类型T没有引用需要的静态（static）生命周期约束
struct Foo<T> {
    foo: &'static T
}
```

下面代码会编译：

```rust
struct Foo<T: 'static> {
    foo: &'static T
}
```
