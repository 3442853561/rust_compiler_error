# E0003

Note: this error code is no longer emitted by the compiler.

Not-a-Number (NaN) values cannot be compared for equality and hence can never match the input to a match expression. So, the following will not compile:

```rust
const NAN: f32 = 0.0 / 0.0;

let number = 0.1f32;

match number {
    NAN => { /* ... */ },
    _ => {}
}
```

To match against NaN values, you should instead use the is_nan() method in a guard, like so:

```rust

let number = 0.1f32;

match number {
    x if x.is_nan() => { /* ... */ }
    _ => {}
}
```
